Tidbit QMK for Windows Blender, Illustrator, iPad Procreate

Files are based on  QMK files provided by u/way_out_west on Reddit. [Layout is based on their Tidbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/tifvxr/built_a_tidbit_macropad_for_procreate_super_fun/).

[nullbitsco provided keymaps were referenced for the edits.](https://github.com/nullbitsco/tidbit/tree/master/keymaps)

The Keymap.c was updated to reflect the additon of the left 2 columns that account for rotary encoder functions.

The layouts for each layer are as follows:

1. Layer 0: Blender
2. Layer 1: Adobe Illustrator
3. Layer 2: Procreate
